# Simple Authentication and Security Framework (SASF)

SASF is a simple framework for PHP that takes the heavy-lifting out of user authentication, session management and permissions. Insofar as reasonably possible, the SASF has been designed not to make any assumptions about your application and thus maintain flexibility and extensibility, whilst also having sane defaults and built-in functionality to cover the most common use cases. The framework has no dependencies other than PHP 7 or above and a supported back-end for data storage.
